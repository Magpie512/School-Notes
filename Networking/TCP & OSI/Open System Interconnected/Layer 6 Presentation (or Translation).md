## What Layer 6 Does
- **Translator of the OSI model**: Converts data between the application layer (Layer 7) and the lower layers so both sender and receiver understand it.
- **Data formatting**: Ensures information is presented in a usable format (e.g., text, images, audio).
- **Encryption & compression**: Handles security and efficiency by encrypting sensitive data and compressing large files for faster transmission.
- **Syntax & semantics**: Makes sure that the meaning and structure of data are preserved across systems.

## Key Responsibilities
- **Data translation**: Converts data from one format to another (e.g., EBCDIC to ASCII).
- **Encryption/decryption**: Protects data during transmission and restores it at the destination.
- **Compression/decompression**: Reduces file size for efficient transfer, then restores it.
- **Compatibility**: Ensures different systems can communicate despite differences in data representation

## Examples of Layer 6 Functions

| Protocol       | Purpose                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| SSL / TLS      | Encrypts Web Traffic for secure communi ation |
| JPEG, GIF, PNG | Formats for image representation              |
| MPEG, MP3      | Formats for video/audio compression           |
| ASCII, Unicode | Text encoding standards                       |
| XML, JSON      | Data structuring for application              |

## Why Layer 6 Matters

- **Security**: Encryption at this layer protects sensitive information like passwords and financial data.
- **Efficiency**: Compression reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up transmission.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures that different systems, applications, and devices can exchange data seamlessly.
- **User experience**: Proper formatting and translation make sure users see readable text, clear images, and smooth audio/video.
