## What Layer 1 Does
- **Raw bit transmission**: Converts digital data (0s and 1s) into electrical, optical, or radio signals for transmission.
- **Physical connections**: Defines the hardware elements like cables, connectors, switches, and radio frequencies.
- **Medium specification**: Determines how signals travel across copper wires, fiber optics, or wireless channels.
- **Data rate control**: Establishes how fast bits are transmitted over the medium.

## Key Responsibilities
- **Bit representation**: Defines voltage levels, light pulses, or radio waves to represent binary data.
- **Physical topology**: Specifies how devices are physically connected (bus, star, ring, mesh).
- **Transmission mode**: Supports simplex (one-way), half-duplex (two-way but one at a time), or full-duplex (two-way simultaneously).
- **Synchronization**: Ensures sender and receiver are aligned in timing for accurate bit interpretation.

## Why Layer 1 Matters
- **Foundation of networking**: Without a physical medium, no data can move between devices.
- **Performance**: Signal quality and bandwidth directly affect higher-layer reliability.
- **Compatibility**: Ensures devices can physically connect and exchange signals.
- **Scalability**: Determines how far and how fast data can travel.
